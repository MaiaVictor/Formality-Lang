## Formality-Lang

Formality-Lang is a set of syntax sugars that transpile to
[Formality-Core](https://github.com/moonad/formality-core). It extends that
minimal core with user-friendly notations such as string literals and datatype
declarations. This is *very temporarily* written in JavaScript, but will soon be
ported to Formality-Core itself (specifically waiting the Equality/Parser of
Formality-Core in itself).
